				<p>
					I built <a href="https://github.com/joemckenney/wake">wake</a>, a tool
					that records your terminal sessions so Claude Code can see what you've
					been doing. The idea is simple: instead of copy-pasting error messages
					or explaining "I tried X and Y but neither worked," your AI assistant
					just... knows.
				</p>

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>
					Claude Code can't see your terminal. It knows about commands it runs,
					but not the builds you kicked off, the errors you saw, the debugging
					you did. I wanted something that captured that context automatically.
				</p>

				<h2>The Design Decision: PTY vs Shell Hooks</h2>
				<p>
					The first real architecture question was how to capture terminal
					activity. Two approaches:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Shell hooks only</strong> (the simple path): zsh and bash have{" "}
					<code>preexec</code>/<code>precmd</code> hooks that fire before and
					after each command. Easy to implement—just append to your{" "}
					<code>.zshrc</code>:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>{`preexec() { log_command "$1" }
precmd() { log_exit_code $? }`}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					The problem: you get what was typed and whether it succeeded, but not
					what happened. The shell doesn't see stdout/stderr—those flow directly
					from child processes to your terminal, bypassing the shell entirely.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>PTY wrapper</strong> (the complete path): Spawn the user's
					shell inside a pseudo-terminal. You sit in the middle, see every byte
					flowing in both directions, log it, pass it through. The user's
					experience is unchanged, but you capture everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					I went with the PTY approach. Knowing that <code>cargo test</code>{" "}
					failed is marginally useful. Knowing{" "}
					<em>which tests failed and why</em> is actually useful.
				</p>

				<h2>The Hybrid Architecture</h2>
				<p>
					Pure PTY capture has its own problem: you get a raw byte stream with
					no structure. Where does one command end and the next begin? You can
					pattern-match on prompts, but that's fragile across different shell
					configurations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution: use both. Shell hooks provide the framing (command
					start, command end, exit code), and the PTY provides the content (what
					actually got printed). The hooks communicate with the main wake
					process over a Unix socket:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>{`┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  wake shell                                                     │
│                                                                 │
│  PTY layer (captures all bytes, attributes to current command)  │
│                          ▲                                      │
│                          │ "command X started/ended"            │
│  Shell hooks ───────────────────────► Unix socket               │
│  (preexec/precmd)                                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘`}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					When <code>preexec</code> fires, wake knows a command is starting and
					begins buffering output. When <code>precmd</code> fires, wake closes
					out that command with its exit code and duration, writes everything to
					SQLite, and starts fresh.
				</p>

				<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
				<p>
					I built this in Rust using <code>portable-pty</code> for
					cross-platform PTY handling. The crate abstracts the differences
					between Linux (<code>/dev/pts/*</code>) and macOS (
					<code>/dev/ttys*</code>), which was one less thing to worry about.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main loop is async (tokio), selecting on stdin, the PTY master fd,
					the Unix socket for hook messages, and signals. Signal handling
					matters more than I expected—you need to forward <code>SIGWINCH</code>{" "}
					(terminal resize) to the child, and handle <code>SIGINT</code>/
					<code>SIGTSTP</code> correctly so ctrl-c and ctrl-z work as expected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Output storage required some decisions. I keep two versions: the raw
					bytes (with ANSI escape codes for colors, cursor movement, etc.) and a
					stripped plaintext version for search and AI consumption. Commands
					with over 5MB of output get truncated by default—configurable if you
					really need more, but nobody needs their entire{" "}
					<code>npm install</code> log in their context window.
				</p>

				<h2>MCP Integration</h2>
				<p>
					The real payoff is the MCP server. Claude Code supports Model Context
					Protocol, which lets you expose tools that Claude can call. Wake's MCP
					server provides:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>wake_status</code> — current session info
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>wake_list_commands</code> — lightweight metadata (command,
						exit code, output size, summary)
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>wake_get_output</code> — fetch full output for specific
						commands
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>wake_search</code> — search across all history
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>wake_dump</code> — export a session as markdown context
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>wake_annotate</code> — add notes to sessions
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The key design is tiered retrieval: <code>wake_list_commands</code>{" "}
					returns metadata and summaries first, letting Claude decide what's
					relevant before fetching full output with <code>wake_get_output</code>
					. This keeps context usage efficient—no more burning tokens on
					irrelevant build logs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now when you ask Claude "why did my deploy fail?", it can pull the
					relevant terminal output directly instead of you having to explain.
				</p>

				<h2>Data Management</h2>
				<p>
					Terminal history grows. Left unchecked, you end up with a database
					full of ancient build logs that nobody will ever look at again. Wake
					handles this automatically—sessions older than 21 days get pruned on
					each <code>wake shell</code> start. If you need manual control:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>{`wake prune --dry-run      # see what would be deleted
wake prune --older-than 7 # delete sessions older than 7 days`}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					Both retention and output limits are configurable via{" "}
					<code>~/.wake/config.toml</code>:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>{`[retention]
days = 21      # default

[output]
max_mb = 5     # default`}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					Environment variables work too (<code>WAKE_RETENTION_DAYS</code>,{" "}
					<code>WAKE_MAX_OUTPUT_MB</code>) if you prefer that style.
				</p>

				<h2>LLM Summarization</h2>
				<p>
					As of v0.6.0, wake ships with local LLM summarization enabled by
					default. The goal was to make tiered retrieval actually
					useful—returning "command failed" isn't helpful, but returning "3
					tests failed: auth timeout in login_test, null pointer in
					user_service, missing mock in api_test" lets Claude understand context
					without fetching megabytes of raw output.
				</p>
				<p>
					The implementation uses <strong>llama.cpp with Qwen3-0.6B</strong>, a
					~380MB model that downloads on first use. It runs locally on CPU with
					no API calls—your terminal history never leaves your machine. If you
					have a GPU, you can build with CUDA or Metal support for faster
					inference, but it's not required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summaries are generated automatically as commands complete and stored
					alongside the raw output. The MCP tools return these summaries in
					metadata responses, so Claude can triage what's relevant before
					deciding what to fetch in full.
				</p>

				<h2>What's Next</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Editor integration</strong>: Terminal is only half the
					picture. File changes, what you had open, what you were looking at—all
					relevant context that's currently not captured. Filesystem watching
					via inotify/FSEvents is straightforward, but deciding what's signal
					versus noise is the hard part.
				</p>

				<h2>Try It</h2>
				<pre>
					<code>{`curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joemckenney/wake/main/install.sh | sh
eval "$(wake init zsh)"
wake shell`}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>Then add the MCP server to Claude Code:</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
						{
							"claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user wake-mcp -- wake-mcp"
						}
					</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					The code is at{" "}
					<a href="https://github.com/joemckenney/wake">
						github.com/joemckenney/wake
					</a>
					. With v0.6.0, the core features—session recording, tiered retrieval,
					and local summarization—are stable. Feedback welcome.
